=================================================================================================

Requires 6 Command Line Argumetns

python id3new.py <training file> <validation file> <test file> <Min Instances to split on> <Mode> <Prune>

All arguments are required, even if you do not use the test or validation file.

Mode can be 1,2,3 or 4. Operation:
	1. Create the tree. Nothing is printed. Pruning is controled by argument 6
	2. Create the tree and print it. Then prune the tree and print that. Argument 6 is ignored
	3. Create the tree. Pruning is controlled by argument 6. Then test the data on the test file. The data is outputted to output.txt
	4. Create many trees using different amounts of training data and checks their accurcy. Records the results in a graph. Pruning can be controlled by argument 6

Example uses

Print an unpruned tree
python id3new.py btrain.csv bvalidate.csv btest.csv 1000 1 0

Print an unpruned tree, then a pruned tree
python id3new.py btrain.csv bvalidate.csv btest.csv 1000 2 0

Create a new testfile called output.txt, with pruning
python id3new.py btrain.csv bvalidate.csv btest.csv 1000 3 1
